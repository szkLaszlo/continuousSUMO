Repository created for a university home assignment

First of all, the SUMO should be installed on the computer. Introductions are [here](https://sumo.dlr.de/docs/Installing.html)

The second step is to install our created environment. (Download or checkout)
Open a terminal in your python environment, and navigate to the source directory of ContinuousSUMO that contains the setup.py
There enter the command 
```bash
pip install .
```
